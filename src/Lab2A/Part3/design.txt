Variables
	No variables used. Builder used for data, genTestData, that generates 24 random integers between 0 and 20.
Input
	Not required, handled by genTestData()
Processing
	Generate test data then with said data:
	Part 1: No process used, just nest-loop through and print
	Part 2: Nest-loop through and set each table value to itself subtracted from the previous value. If no previous value, print 0;
	Part 3: Calculate the sum of each row of data
	Part 4: Same process as number 2, using part 3 instead of part 1.
	Part 5: Calculate the average of each row of data
	Part 6: Find the largest value of each row and print it's index
Printing
	Generate test data and then call all 6 print functions with said data.
